* update to 2.63 and its BMeshes - rking (freenode #blender) on that: "Here's what you need to know: import bmesh; b = bmesh.from_edit_mesh(obj.data)" "BTW, the .from_edit_mesh is for when you're in Edit Mode on that mesh (it will update right away for changes, but it will expire when you toggle Edit Mode). For a more durable reference, but not real-time: b = bmesh.new(); b.from_mesh(obj.data)"
